## Introduction
The CSS has been modified with reference to IntelliJ color schemes.  
Confirmed to work properly on Obsidian v1.8.9.

## Features
- Title Style Change: Added a pen icon at the beginning of titles to make it clear when editing is in progress, and used an animated background effect to keep things visually engaging.
- Added lines below H2 headings to help distinguish between sections more clearly.
- Used different colors to emphasize text and make it stand out.
- Change the default font to `S-CoreDream-3Light`.
- Added folder icons in the file explorer to make it easier to distinguish between folders and files.
