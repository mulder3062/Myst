Myst Theme for Obsidian.

## Introduction
The CSS has been modified with reference to IntelliJ color schemes.  
Confirmed to work properly on Obsidian v1.8.9.

## Features
- Title Style Change: Added a pen emoji at the beginning of titles to make it clear when editing is in progress, and used an animated background effect to keep things visually engaging.
- Added lines below H2 headings to help distinguish between sections more clearly.
- Used different colors to emphasize text and make it stand out.
- Included the free `S-CoreDream-3Light` font for offline use, which offers excellent readability, especially for Korean text.
- Added folder icons (emojis) in the file explorer to make it easier to distinguish between folders and files.
